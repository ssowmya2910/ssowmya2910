👋 Hi there! I'm Sowmya S
I'm a passionate programmer who consistently strives to improve and grow in the field of software development. Even with a demanding academic schedule, I make time every day to enhance my skills through problem-solving and project building.

💻 Competitive Programming Enthusiast
I actively solve problems on platforms like:

-LeetCode

-GeeksforGeeks

-Coding Ninjas

To sharpen my problem-solving speed and spontaneous thinking, I regularly participate in coding contests on:

-Codeforces

-AtCoder

🛠️ MERN Stack Developer
Alongside competitive programming, I'm diving deep into full-stack web development using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

Some of my notable projects include:

🎵 Music Player Web App – A full-featured audio streaming app with modern UI.

✅ To-Do List Web App – A clean and simple productivity tool to manage tasks.

🚀 Always Learning, Always Building
I'm always on the lookout for new challenges, learning opportunities, and ways to contribute to meaningful projects.
